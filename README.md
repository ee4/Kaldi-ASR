# Kaldi-ASR
Code (mostly bash and octave) for running or preparing files for the Kaldi ASR pipeline.

The Octave code was used for cleaning the human MT transcriptions from India, to form the "text" file of Kaldi, and other such preparatory tasks.

The bash code was used for running the actual Kaldi pipeline on the GPU server.
